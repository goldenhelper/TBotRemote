            1. **Chain-of-Thought Process**:  
                - **Step 2**: Analyze recent messages. Identify key details with special attention to:
                    * Character traits, preferences, and patterns
                    * Time-sensitive information (events, deadlines, future plans)
                    * Emotional states or personal situations
                    * For group chats: Interpersonal dynamics and relationships between members
                - **Step 3**: Cross-check with existing notes. Flag duplicates, outdated info, or role-critical gaps.  
                - **Step 4**: Decide what to add/modify/retain based on:
                    * Relevance to your role
                    * Temporal importance (attach dates where applicable)
                    * Long-term value for relationship building
                    * Group dynamics (for group chats)
                
            2. **Temporal Information Handling**:
                - For time-sensitive information (e.g., "birthday next week", "job interview tomorrow"):
                    * Add a temporal tag [Until: YYYY-MM-DD] for expiration dates
                    * Update/remove expired time-sensitive entries
                - For persistent traits or preferences:
                    * Mark with [Core Trait] to indicate high retention priority
                - For temporary states (moods, situations):
                    * Use to update understanding of character but don't retain specific instances unless pattern-forming

            3. **Memory Retention Guidelines**:
                - Preserve information about core traits, preferences, and important facts
                - Be conservative with deletions - only remove notes that are:
                    * Conclusively outdated or superseded
                    * Contradicted by newer, more reliable information
                    * No longer relevant to your role or the conversation trajectory
                - If uncertain about relevance, retain the information
                - Condense similar or related information to maintain conciseness

            4. **Group Chat Relationship Tracking**:
                - Map relationships and dynamics between members:
                    * Identify close friendships, rivalries, or professional connections
                    * Note conversation patterns (who talks to whom, response tones)
                    * Record shared experiences or inside references between members
                    * Track shifting alliances or relationship changes over time
                - Use relationship tags to organize interpersonal information:
                    * [Relation: Person1-Person2] to mark relationship-specific notes
                    * [Group Dynamic] for patterns involving multiple members
                - Consider the social context when responding (e.g., avoiding topics sensitive to specific relationships)

            5. **Output Format**:  
                - Output ONLY the final notes without tags.
                - Notes should be UNDER 250 words.
                - Notes should be in the same language as your role or the conversation.
                - Use bullet points for clarity and organization.
                - Include temporal and relationship tags where appropriate.

            <!-- Example: Life Coach Role (Private Chat) -->
            <thinking>
                1. My role is "Life Coach": I need to track goals, obstacles, personal values, and progress.
                2. In recent messages (dated 2025-02-25):
                - User mentioned starting a new job on March 15th
                - User expressed anxiety about public speaking
                - User shared they'll be visiting parents April 5-10
                - User mentioned they value work-life balance repeatedly
                3. Current notes review:
                - Already have "enjoys hiking on weekends" - still relevant
                - Have "preparing for job interview" - now outdated since they got the job
                - Have "struggles with morning routine" - no recent mention, but likely still relevant
                4. Actions needed:
                - Remove job interview note and replace with new job info
                - Add public speaking anxiety as character trait
                - Add time-sensitive parent visit
                - Strengthen note about work-life balance as a core value
                - Retain hiking preference and morning routine struggle
            </thinking>
            <updated_notes>
                - [Core Trait] Values work-life balance strongly
                - [Core Trait] Experiences anxiety about public speaking

            <!-- Example: Group Moderator Role (Group Chat) -->
            <thinking>
                1. My role is "Group Moderator": I need to track group dynamics, individual preferences, discussion topics, and potential sensitivities.
                2. In recent messages (dated 2025-03-01):
                - Alex and Jamie discussed their shared interest in rock climbing

                - Alex has consistently shown expertise in finance topics
                - Jamie and Taylor appear to know each other outside the group
                3. Current notes review:
                - Already noted "Chris tends to dominate conversations" - reinforced by recent behavior
                - Have "group book discussion scheduled Feb 20th" - now outdated
                - Have "Sam is new to the group" - still relevant
                4. Actions needed:
                - Remove outdated book discussion note
                - Add Jamie-Alex rock climbing connection
                - Add Taylor-Chris tension
                - Add Sam's hiking plan
                - Note Jamie-Taylor external relationship
                - Strengthen note about Alex's finance expertise
                - Retain Chris's conversation style and Sam's newcomer status
